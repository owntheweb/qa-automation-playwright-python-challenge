## Linux Setup

Important: Don't install Playwright Python on an Windows WSL instance. It gets super funky when trying to make use of headed mode. WSL doesn't have all the permissions and setting that up is tough and flaky (just follow the Windows instructions and stick to Windows). If only wanting to run in headless mode, go forth.

This will be Max/Unix-like, however install is differently. Look up pyenv installation for your distribution and update this file with instructions. :)
